## ERD ASSIGNMENT

Introduction
	In this assignment you will create an Entity Relationship Diagram that captures the information needed in the APC Case. As before, set up the context for the assignment.
    •	Explain the purpose of this assignment, and how it relates to what we are doing in class. The assumption here is that you have taken database classes and are familiar with the structure of ERDs. If that is not true, then you should contact me for some one-on-one time to go over the elements of an ERD.
    •	Setup up the context of the paper for the APC reader. Why do they care about this?
    •	Provide a brief overview of each section below

Topic Analysis

Part 1: Identify the entities for whom you need to store data
  •	Provide a setup/introduction to explain to APC what the section does and define any new terms.
  •	Identify those entities (person, place or thing) about which you need to collect information. The Dataflow Diagram highlighted the process and the data that flows between them. The ERD highlights those objects about which the data is collected.
  •	Demonstrate that your understand the relationships between the entities and the functional requirements You have figured out the business rules of APC through your understanding of the requirements and the processes that are generated from them.
  •	Now think about the elements within the project that are supported by the data stores you found in the Data Flow diagram. For example, one of the use cases surely supported the journey of the manuscripts from author to APC and then on to the publishing process. One obvious entity then would be the manuscript. Another might be the contract, etc.
  •	Provide a summary for the section to help the APC make sense of what you have discovered here

Part 2: Identify the attributes of interest for each entity
  •	Provide a setup/introduction to this section to help the reader understand the importance of getting the right attributes identified through the requirements
  •	Given that you have identified the entities (aka as tables in the database context), identify the attributes of those attributes that you need to store to service the use cases you have identified. Resist the urge to add anything you think might be useful to them in the future. For now just add those attributes that are required to service the requirements.  This is an iterative process in the real world, so you may discover additional attributes later that you missed on the first pass. Just explain why you choose these attributes and relate them to the requirements (RID) they are designed to service. These attributes, plus a primary key, become the attributes you use to populate each table within the ERD.
  •	Create a table to show the data type, length and any constraints for each of the attributes
  •	Provide a summary for the APC reader to make sure they understand the relationship between the attributes and the functional requirements

Part 3: Establish the relationships between the entities
  •	Provide a setup/introduction to this section to help the reader understand the importance of identifying the relationships between entities  
  •	Using Visual Paradigm, create tables and include the primary key for the table and any foreign keys needed to relate to other tables. Remember, if you relate two tables, then one has the primary and the other needs to have the same key used as a foreign key.
  •	Tell the reader about the relationships and identify their cardinality. Use Visual Paradigm to create your ERD. Show the relationships and the cardinality between tables. Remember that just showing the ERD is not sufficient. Be sure to make the connection between the functional requirements list and your final ERD.
  •	You need to provide a clear explanation of what you did and why you did it. please include a figure # and descriptive title for each graphic. If your graphic is too large to read when you embed it in your doc, then screenshot sections of it to flow with your explanations.
  •	Provide a Summary for the APC reader to help them understand the significance of the ERD for their system design.

Conclusion
  •	Provide a clear summary of what you learned in the exercise. 
  •	Demonstrate your understanding of the purpose and uses of an Entity Relationship Diagram and identify when you would use this tool. Identify how this tool would be used with the stakeholders of the project

If you use references, put them on a separate reference page with APA formatted references
