## ERD ASSIGNMENT

Introduction

  The purpose of this assignment is to create a document for the APC employees to view and see how different data store entities work, relate, and function in their new system. This document will also work to outline the different types of data that will go into each one of the entities and how that data will be connected to other entities. In the diagram, entities are represented by boxes with lines linking them to various attributes, which describe the entityâ€™s qualities or characteristics. This entity relationship diagram gives a snapshot of how these entities relate to each other.

  Throughout this document there will be detailed sections about what the different entities are, what attributes and data types they have, and how and why they connect the way they connect. All these sections are labeled for the reader and have been explained to make sure the reader knows what is happening.


Topic Analysis

Part 1: Identify the entities for whom you need to store data

  In this section APC's new business entities will be laid out for readers to view. Each entity is a certain aspect of APC's new workflow system which will be put in place to improve productivity. All these different entities have self explanatory names but will be further defined in the following information:

    Manuscripts - This is a data store for all the manuscripts that have come into APC. It doesn't matter what stage they are at or if they are already printed; this is where they are stored. This means that all access to manuscripts is through this entity.

    Authors - This is a data store for all the authors that have come to APC.

    Ledger Cards - This is a data store for all the ledger cards that APC has created to keep track of accounts. Ledger cards are seen as the filling system for APC and they display the main information for different accounts that relate to authors, printers, sponsorship, etc. and will have a link to the spreadsheet that has the actual finance accounting. Think of it as the contact list for all financial dealings.

    Accounts - This is a data store for all the financial accounts that APC has. This could range from business operation finances to deals with sponsors, authors, or printers.

    Inventory - This is a data store for all the inventory that APC currently has.

    Orders - This is a data store for all the orders that have been placed for APC to print a certain book.

    Contracts - This is a data store for all the contracts that APC has on file. As stated in other documents APC will have several basic contracts that will be constantly used, then there will also be the adapted contracts that have special deals in them that required a change.

    Illustrations/Artwork - This is a data store for all the Illustrations/Artwork that APC has created or bought for certain titles that they are producing.

    Printers - This is a data store for all the different printers that APC has used previously in there business.

    Sponsorship - This is a data store for all the different sponsors that APC has used previously or that have interest in sponsoring a new book.

    Employee's - This is a data store for all the employees at APC. It will be used as a system management data store where all employee information is held to allow credential levels for checks when editing information.



Part 2: Identify the attributes of interest for each entity

  In this section APC's attributes for each given entity will be explained and outlined. These attributes will be the variables and content that will fill the entity. Each variable will have a different type of value. In this given case there are only two use values int, which stands for integer, and varchar, which stands for character data. Primary keys are the identifier for the main field that will be used to identify a specific entity. The attribute that is labeled with primary key is the attribute that will be used to find/search and identify individual records and information that is in the data stores.

  There are also two fields that will be used throughout the entities, links, and info. Links will be a simple link to a document that cannot fit in a database field. Info is a common field that will just be there for extra information in case there is important information for that entity that cannot be explained by the main fields. These different variables will be assigned to the many entities in the following information:


  Manuscripts
    Title - varchar
    Author - varchar
    ID - int
    Status - varchar
    ISBN - varchar
    Manuscripts Link - varchar

    Phone - int
    Email - varchar
    Ledger link - varchar

  Ledger Cards
    Name - varchar
    Type - varchar
    ID - int
    Value - int
    Spreadsheet link - varchar

  Accounts
    Name - varchar
    Type - varchar
    ID - int
    Value - int
    Spreadsheet link - varchar

  Orders
    Title - varchar
    ISBN - varchar
    Amount - int
    Info - varchar
    Status - varchar

  Contracts
    Title - varchar
    Contract Link - varchar

  Illustrations/Artwork
    Title - varchar
    Manuscripts - varchar
    Status - varchar
    Illustrations/Artwork Link - varchar

  Printers
    Name - varchar
    Average Price - int
    Number Previous Jobs - int
    Info - varchar

  Sponsorship
    Name - varchar
    Average Price - int
    Number Previous Jobs - int
    Info - varchar

  Employee's
    First name - varchar
    Last name - varchar
    Email - varchar
    Phone - int
    ID - int
    Type - varchar
    Access level - int

Part 3: Establish the relationships between the entities

  In this section APC's new entities will show the given relationships that they have with other entities. These relationships are how they will communicate and exchange data. In these relationships there are several different ways to communicate. First we have One, then Many, then One(and only one), then zero or one, then one or many, and finally zero or many. These relationships are there to show how one entity will perceive another. For example an entity of "orders" would have a one to one relationship with an entity called "customers" because there can only be one customer per order and there has to be a customer for an order. The entity relationships for APC's entities will be shown in the following information:

  Manuscripts	            1:M	Authors
  Manuscripts	            0:M	Sponsorship
  Manuscripts	            0:M	Contracts
  Manuscripts	            0:M	Printers
  Manuscripts	            0:M	Illustrations/Artwork
  Manuscripts	            0:M	Inventory
  Authors	                0:M	Manuscripts
  Authors	                0:M	Contracts
  Ledger-Cards	          1:M	Accounts
  Ledger-Cards	          0:M	Contracts
  Accounts	              1:1	Ledger-Cards
  Inventory	              0:M	Orders
  Inventory	              1:1	Manuscripts
  Orders	                1:1	Inventory
  Contracts	              0:1	Authors
  Contracts	              0:M	Ledger-Cards
  Contracts	              1:1	Manuscripts
  Illustrations/Artwork	  1:1	Manuscripts
  Printers	              0:M	Manuscripts
  Sponsorship	            0:M	Manuscripts
  Employee's	            1:1	Ledger-Cards


Conclusion

  In this assignment there are several key elements that have been used for my learning benefit. First we have the demonstration of the entities that are in the APC scenario. By creating and outlining these entities it becomes more clear where the data will be stored and how they related to the APC scenario. Next there are the attributes that fit into each of those entities. These are extremely important and all you to dive even deeper into what is happening in the data stores and how each entity will process certain data. Lastly there are the relationships between the entities which really helped define how all the different entities where connected and how the overall APC system would and wouldn't work.

  Overall I do think this was a good assignment to show how to create and represent relationships between entities in a project. I do think there are some large holes in thinking that would have to be corrected and defined but overall there was some great practice on how to think through a problem and plan out the ways that data will be stored and connected.
