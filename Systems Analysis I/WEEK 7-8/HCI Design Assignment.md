## HCI DESIGN ASSIGNMENT

Setup for Human Computer Interface Design assignment

  In this assignment, you can work in a team, or you can work by yourself if you choose. The goal of the assignment is for you to make a first attempt at designing the elements of the human computer interaction interface needed for your project. You can either create user screens using programming tools, or Desktop wireframes from within Visual Paradigm. My expectations is that after reading the materials in Chapter 9 and the other supporting videos, you will create a prototype/storyboard graphical user interface that would be used by the users of the system to navigate the new components of the system you are adding in this project.
  If you choose to work in teams of 2 or 3, you can choose your own teammates or I will assemble teams from those expressing an interest. I would recommend that teams use Zoom (provided with Blackboard) to hold team meetings and discussions. I will expect that all members of the teams carry their fair share of the assignment load.
  We will consider the HOME page as your level 1, although you will likely have a login page as your level 0. I want you to take your design down one level below Level 1. Rather than showing Level 2 for all possible process areas, pick two of your most complex processes and use than as examples of your design. You will create a separate wireframe graphic for each page and you will embed those graphics into your assignment narrative . Do not assume that the graphic is sufficient to explain what you did . You must thoroughly explain what you did and why it is sufficient to meets the requirements of the system. Tell me exactly how your design satisfies the requirements we identified for this project. Explain the choices in your design as a function of the design tools in Chapter 9 and as a refinement of the models we have worked on so far.

Human-Computer Interface Design Report

  Introduction

    Setup the assignment and provide the necessary context for the user interface design. In this setup you will explain your chosen design method and relate it back to the design elements in Chapter 9. Note: One possible way to organize your interface is to organize your navigation system around the use cases we have already identified in the use case diagram. For instance, you could create navigation buttons that follow the names given each of the use cases as a logical way for people to work within a specific process. You have already determined that all requirements are satisfied within those use cases. You design must comprehend the requirements of the system as identified earlier in the term

  Analysis (Divide this analysis into appropriate sections with bolded headings for each)

    •	Provide a narrative that explains how you plan to approach your design given the design elements covered in chapter 9 of the text.
    •	Develop a wireframe GUI that shows how you will service the requirements (Use Visual Paradigm's Desktop Wireframe tool)
    •	Demonstrate that you have comprehended the principles for the user interface design as shown in Chapter 9
    •	Demonstrate in your narrative that you understand how your design comes from your knowledge of the requirements of the TO-BE system Provide a discussion on your approach to the design and make sure I can see why you think it serves APC needs.
    •	Explain how your design services all the major system components
