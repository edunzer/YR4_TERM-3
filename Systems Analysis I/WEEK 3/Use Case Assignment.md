## USE CASE ASSIGNMENT

Introduction (student to Instructor focus)

  Introduction clearly explains the purpose of this assignment and how it relates to the topic under study for the week

    The idea of this assignment is to take the broad business processes that were listed in the last assignment and turn them into working use cases. This mostly cleans up and combines multiple processes into one use-case but it also refines the details about how a process will be used in a use-case.  

  A context is provided that demonstrates the students understanding on how satisfying the Functional Requirements serves the needs of the project stakeholders

    These cleaned up use-cases will be the solidified system functions that need to take place in creating the final version of this project. Or in other words these are the main needs of the APC team in order for them to function better and achieve there growth goals without over extending themselves with too much system infrastructure.

  Setup the context of how use cases are used in analyzing the new APC system.

    Every use case is used as a combination of processes that are were brought to my attention by the employee testimonies about there individual roles at APC. These testimonies stated there day to day routine along with known problems that they had during those day to day routines. These problems and overall routines were then listed out as processes and then converted into use-cases. Many of the processes that were stated individually by employees could be resolved and updated to the new system through a single use-case. There were multiple instances where this was the case and often they had to do with the digital record keeping system that will part of the overall system.

Organizing requirements into high level business processes (NAS to APC focus)

  Brief introduction to the concept of business processes

    Business processes are a collection of linked tasks that together will create a service or product that the business will then give to the customer. These are normally small activities that works will do on a daily basis to fulfill the companies working needs. Now the level of these processes can differ based on the employee level but they are always important to completing day to day tasks for an end goal of the business. For example APC has many business processes that revolve around paper work, and each of those instances were an employee files, or completes paperwork they have being using a business process. 

  Narrative shows that you have identified the major high-level business processes needed for the APC TO-BE system

  Have selected between 5 & 9 high-level business processes (aka Use Cases) that will satisfy all actor requirements

  Section Summary

  Using the requirements list supplied by the instructor, identify the high-level business processes that incorporate the requirements for the system. Every requirement should be satisfied by one (or perhaps more) of these identified business processes. Look in the Support Materials folders for a definition of a business process. You will identity between 5 & 9 high level business processes that reflect the changes that need to be established for the new system. These high-level business processes are to be identified with verb/noun names. i.e. Manage Inventory or Review Manuscripts. Use the supplied spreadsheet to identify how these processes are connected to the functional requirements identified earlier. Provide enough narrative to demonstrate your thinking in connecting the requirements with the business processes.   



Use Case Diagram (NAS to APC focus)

  Brief introduction to the benefits of use cases are a way to model businesses

  Rich narrative explaining how your use case diagram encapsulates the requirements of the TO-BE system

  Thorough explanation of your thinking in designing the diagram. Defend your logic.

  Section Summary


  • Provide a rich narrative explaining how your use case diagram encapsulates the requirements of the system
  • Provide a thorough explanation of how you came to the design of the use case diagram and be sure to explain how it satisfies the requirements of all the actors
  • Include a UML Use Case Diagram graphic showing all elements of your use case diagram. Tie your narrative to that diagram as if you were explaining it to the APC team

Conclusion (student to instructor focus)

  Provide a clear summary of what you learned in this exercise. Try not to give me general comments that you think I want to hear. Tell what you have learned about how the requirements analysis and use case diagram fit together in solving the APC set of problems.
