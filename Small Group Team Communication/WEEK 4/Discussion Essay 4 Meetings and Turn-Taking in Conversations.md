## DISCUSSION ESSAY 4 | MEETINGS & TURN TAKING IN CONVERSATIONS

Answer all of the following prompts:

  - Which Conversational Maxim do you break the most? Why? Give an example.

    I would say if I broke any of the maximums it would be of quantity. Most of the time I have a preview of what I'm thinking in my mind and I simplify it so much that by the time I say it out loud it only makes sense to me. Its a constant problem that I have where I don't explain my self in as much detail as I should and instead I end up saying something that doesn't quite meet the requirements of a good explain to others.
