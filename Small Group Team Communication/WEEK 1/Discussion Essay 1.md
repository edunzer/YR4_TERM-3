## DISCUSSION ESSAY 1 | INTRODUCTION TO SMALL GROUP & TEAM COMMUNICATION

Respond to two of the prompts below (your choice):

- Provide a detailed example of a group/team interaction that was impacted by "noise" and how it could have been avoided or how your team dealt with it.  (A good way to approach this is to tell a short story about the incident and then highlight the "noise".)

- One of the key characteristics of groups is interdependence. This is an essential component to determine if a group or team is necessary for a given situation or problem. Describe your interdependent role in your field or potential field. What do people depend on you for that they can't do themselves and vice versa.
    
    As someone that is going into the marketing operations felid my dependencies would be the people in charge of what products are offered through the company along with the data that is then given based on who is purchasing these products. So sales people, data collectors, engineers would be roles that I would directly contact on a daily basis to fulfil my role in the company. 

    Furthermore the people that would depend on me would be the entire marketing team since marketing operations is the bridge between the product/engineers and the marketers. I would give them the information they need about the product in an effective manor that they can understand and use more effectively in there field. 

- Based on the reading What is a Team - describe 3 practices that can make a team more successful.

    According to the reading a team is a group that of people that organized a function as a group. This is often achieved successfully through Collaboration, demanding performance standards, and direction are the three practices that enable effective teamwork. Performance standards allows for the team to have a drive to finish there work and not get slowed down by small problems or becoming complacent. Clear concise direction creates standards and set goals that cannot be changed. Having multiple people work on a single project without clear direction is a disaster waiting to happen since everyone has there own thoughts and ideas. Lastly collaboration is what can really turbocharge a team working on a project. As stated above everyone has there own thoughts and ideas and when put into a large group all those ideas and styles get stuck together and halt progress. Enabling collaboration between similar group members on single aspects of the same project can allow for easy back and forth creativity and problem solving. 

- What are 3 advantages and 3 disadvantages of working in groups? Give examples.
