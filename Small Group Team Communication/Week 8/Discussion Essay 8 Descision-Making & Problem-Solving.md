## DISCUSSION ESSAY 8 | DECISION-MAKING & PROBLEM-SOVLING

What are two pros and two cons of using the brainstorming method to generate potential solutions?

  Pros:

    - Quick, random thinking in a low-pressure environment could create new alternative solutions that wouldn't have been thought of in a structured one.

    - Having a dedicated moment to think about only one problem can create more understanding of that problem and helping to reveal new solutions and ideas.

  Cons:

    - This can be time consuming and frustrating if that time takes to long.

    - Let down can happen when ideas are suggested that are no where near workable or viable.

If a group has some members that are very vocal and dominate discussions with their opinions- what could the group do to allow each member to submit their views equally? AKA- not in a discussion format.

  - Most importantly I think you need to isolate people and not have them in a group discussion format as suggested. In order to stop people from being dominant in a scenario you need to separate them so that the passive members can speak and share.

  - The next idea is that you could try and help the passive members come out of there shells by having them pitch ideas before an actual group discussion. This was described in the reading as a "warm-up brainstorm" which allows for members to communicate in a small group setting and become more comfortable with there ideas.

Give an example of a problem that would be addressed best by the Group Problem-Solving Process (Standard Agenda). Since this is a detailed process why would your example problem necessitate this method?

  - This would most likely be a large problem that can have many solutions but needs to follow certain guidelines so that the solutions that are suggested will be in a scope of the problem. For example a business that sells a product has been informed that one of there biggest partners is not renewing there contract. This will create a huge monetary loss for the business and they need to figure out how to stay solvent.

  - This problem would most likely be only known by higher up management but in order to get ideas the business would want to use all there resources and employees that they have. So by using the Group Problem-Solving Process
  all possible scenarios would have to go through the stricter standards that will only allows certain ideas to pass. Also the Group Problem-Solving Process makes it a priority to explain the problem and analyze it which would be necessary in this example.
