## DISCUSSION ESSAY 6 | LEADERSHIP

Leadership: A lot of content to cover but we'll narrow the essay down to two of the Situational models.

Fiedler's Contingency Theory of Leadership (p394-396): Give an example of a situation when a high-LPC leader would be more effective than a low-LPC leader. Vice versa.

  - Since the entire idea of a high LPC leaders is that they value a relationship more then task completion they would do best in an environment where long relationships are valued. So for example if you where a manager at a small company and you cant afford to give out bonuses whenever someone does great instead you have to show appreciation in relationships to the employee. On the other hand a manager with a large company that can afford bonuses and personnel loss can have a low LPC because they can give bonuses to people with there agreed level of task completion.

Hersey-Blanchard Situational Leadership Model (handout and slides): Give an example of a team who requires Stage 1 (Directive Leadership Style). Identify what level their member readiness is at (competence + commitment). Describe what you would look for in the team to transition to stage 2 (Coaching). How did their member readiness change, why? What role did the leader play in that change?

  - Since stage 1 or Directing style is the most evolved I would say the group would be full of entry level people that have little to no experience or knowledge of what is happening. This would obviously require much direction and constant oversight by the leader to make sure things are getting done and that there commitment is there to complete tasks. They would be a level 1 on the readiness scale since they expect someone to organize and suggest a path.  

  - In order for this previous team to advance to stage 2 or Coaching style they would need to show that they don't have to be corrected often or at all, and that they can have helpful advice that proves useful to the project or task at hand. These are two elements that are suggested in the Coaching description and show that the team can move along. Also there readiness would be around level 3 since they want to communicate and share ideas along with being prepared to completed tasks.
