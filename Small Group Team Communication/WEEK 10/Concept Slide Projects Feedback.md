## CONCEPT SLIDE PROJECTS FEEDBACK

Choose one member from your team to upload your slideshow to this discussion. Review all of the slideshows once they are posted. Each member of your team should provide brief feedback to each of the other group's slideshows. A good method is the feedback sandwich....  You will be graded individually.

1. Begin with something the group did well.
  - I really like the introduction slides, the pictures really make it more personal and real.
2. Suggest something that could be improved.
  - The colors of the text being different does make it a challenge to read in some occasions and some slides seemed to have more text then necessary. Making them shorted and more concise would make it easier to read through.
3. End with what you liked overall.
  - The overall flow of the PowerPoint was great, everyone seemed to have put a good amount of effort into there slides and provided great information.
