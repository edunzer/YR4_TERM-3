## CONCEPT SLIDE PROJECTS FEEDBACK

Choose one member from your team to upload your slideshow to this discussion. Review all of the slideshows once they are posted. Each member of your team should provide brief feedback to each of the other group's slideshows. A good method is the feedback sandwich....  You will be graded individually.

1. Begin with something the group did well.
2. Suggest something that could be improved.
3. End with what you liked overall.
