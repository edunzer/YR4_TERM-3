## DISCUSSION ESSAY 2 | GROUP DEVLEOPMENT

Read the case study on Group Cohesiveness on pages 300-301 and answer the 3 short-answer questions at the end. The begin with:

  1. What challenges does a large project like Ford’s F-150 project have to take into account for success?
    - The biggest oversight that commonly happens with large team projects is that there is always loss of information. If there are even more then 10 people in a group making sure that everyone is on the same page is a constant battle. Now just imagine what happens when you have teams inside of teams like at ford. You have the design team, engineering, etc. and then there are teams inside of those teams. Large companies like ford need to make sure that when something is changed in the project everyone knows about it. This enables all other teams to make there changes according to the changes that have already been made and no problems are created.

  2. What kind of work teams did Ford employ throughout its project to get the best results?
    - Ford used parallel work teams that are designed to work along side of each other but on different problems. So for example when designing the f-150 the ford teams all had different areas of expertise, or functional areas that they would work on. These areas would work separately on there own tasks while still following the same schedule as those other teams. This allows there progress to be in parallel to the other teams and therefore allow for better functional designs.

  3. Can Ford’s successes be translated into other smaller teams? How would you apply its best practices
to a work environment of your own?
    - Like I said above any team over 10 people needs a structure to help them work. So yes I do think that small teams or businesses could use the same model as ford to complete there projects. I don't really see it as a crazy new idea that ford came up with, its really just dividing the work among people that have the expertise while making sure that each group finishes the deadlines at the same time.
