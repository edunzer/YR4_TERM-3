  - After taking the Listening Styles Questionnaire, discuss the pros and cons of your listening style and give examples.

    Well I have high levels of all 4 attributes, Time Oriented Listener is the highest in particular. This means that my cons are: I'm overly detail orientated, tend to be impatient with time wasters, and ask blunt questions. I can say for certain that these are defiantly attributes that I have and make me who I am. Whether I find these cons or not is up for debate. Some pros that I have are that I value technical information, I encourage others to be organized and concise, and I like to manage and save time.

  - Choose 3-4 of the Listening Responses that you have used, or will likely, use in your workplace or field. Give examples.

    "Asking questions to understand the situation better", would be my first choice. Then "Considering possible solutions to what the speaker has said", would be my second. Then moving on to offensive listening I would pick "Assessing the best course of action". These three listening responses would allow me to understand the listener the best and also come up with responses that could help my side of the conversation.
