## DISCUSSION ESSAY 7 | CONFLICT IN GROUPS

Read the excerpt on p 449-450 Managerial Leadership: Executive Conflict Resolution Strategies. Respond to the following:

  Which of these reactions to conflict do you feel would lead to more productive results?+

    - Well I think it really depends on the scenario. Constructive confrontation would work great in environments where the views are often completely different but subordinates often don't have the courage to stand up. By making sure they are appreciated for disagreement and different views could allow for a great environment where views and ideas are constantly discussed and ironed out. On the other hand this would not work in a group where to much discussion happens and the chain of power is collapsing.

    Also if we look at the other conflict style where all opposing ideas are rejected then we have positives and negatives as well. In certain scenarios where subordinates are becoming to comfortable with opposing the ideas of the leading members then it can be necessary to correct that behavior. This of course would only be in a scenario where the leadership is only doing what they want and they don't want that to change. But as shown above having an environment where people are not afraid to correct management can also be very beneficial and often correct huge problems of power discrepancies in the workplace.

  How do you feel you would respond to such conflict?

    - I think I could work in either way. Often when I go into a job there are moments where you can gauge how open management is to ideas and changes coming from there subordinates. After doing this I know my place and if they think that everything they do is right and that's the way its going to be then that's the way it is. I'm working for them so if I don't like it then I can leave and work somewhere else. On the other hand if they constantly want my opinion and ideas then that's what I'm there to give them.

    Yes one could be seen as a "nicer place to work" in some scenarios where your work decisions mean a lot to you but at the end of the day no matter how a manager handles a scenario its there decision to make.
