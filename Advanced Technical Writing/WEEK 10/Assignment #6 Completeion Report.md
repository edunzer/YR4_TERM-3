## ASSIGNMENT #6 COMPLETION REPORT

Overview of Assignment
  Completion reports are end-of-project reports that signal the closing of the project. They often package all together the project items and explain to the reader (usually a client or a project manager) the deliverables and a summary of the entire project.

  Completion reports also act as a historical document for an organization as proof of work and as a catalog of the experiences along the way. Internal completion reports often document challenges encountered, changes in scope, and ways to improve in a similar future project.

Purpose of Assignment: Skills Practiced and Knowledge Gained
  • Create technical documents that are tailored to the specific needs and expectations of a
  professional audience; clearly define an audience and their need(s)
  • Compose focused, organized technical documents, including a statement of purpose, a
  clear hierarchy of information, and consistent, logical organizing elements
  • Thoroughly support your work with professional source materials, and use and cite those
  materials effectively and responsibly
  • Compose work that applies standard English usage and professional formatting, and
  make use of published guidebooks to aid your work
  • Create effective designs and informative visuals for technical/professional documents

Content of Completion Report
  ❏ Introduction orients the reader to the report's content and purpose and provides an overview of what is in the completion report.
  ❏ Project Scope & Goals describes the topics covered in both technical documents (the
  technical description and the technical instructions) & explains the goals of the project
  (what the client asked of you in creating the documents, the purpose of the documents,
  and who the documents are for).
  ❏ Methods of Inquiry & Research explains the approaches or strategies that you took to
  learn about the object/mechanism/process and the policy & procedure/user manual. (In

  ❏ Findings from Inquiry & Research describes the results of your inquiry/research process and explains how you used that information in creating the documents.
  ❏ Project Challenges & Learning Experience explains your personal work experiences
  with creating the client documents. What challenges did you face in learning about the
  topic? What challenges did you face in completing the technical documents? What new
  knowledge and skills did you learn from completing the technical documents? What
  would you have done differently if you were do a project like this again?
  ❏ Conclusion thanks the client for the opportunity to create the technical documents and
  prefaces the deliverables (attached to the completion report).
