## WEEK 10 DISCUSSION

In this final exam week of the course, write a 300-350 word (total) reflection about what you have learned about technical writing. In this reflection response, address each of the following topics in as a separate paragraph (so aiming for about 100 words for each prompt). Then, reply to TWO classmates' posts.

  How has your understanding of technical writing changed from the beginning of this course to the end? (Be specific and provide examples from your week 1 discussion post and other discussions/learning activities over the course.)

  What have you learned specifically about the genres covered in this course (select any to discuss: project proposals, technical descriptions, technical instructions, usability reports, and completion reports) that you did not know before taking this course? (Be specific and provide examples from any of the course readings and activities.)

  What have you learned generally about technical writing/editing skills and APA skills that you did not know before taking this class? (Be specific and provide examples from any of the course readings and activities.)
