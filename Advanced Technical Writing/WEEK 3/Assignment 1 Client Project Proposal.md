## ASSIGNMENT #1 | CLIENT PROJECT PROPOSAL

Introduction
  Brief overview of the client (who the client is and your relationship to the client).

    The client of this project is Appalachia Publishing Collective (APC). APC is a small organization who specializes in publishing books by Appalachian authors about topics of interest in the Appalachian region. Maria Burdett, who is the chairwoman of the Appalachia Publishing Collective, was originally the one that reached out to New Age Systems (NAS) and is the head of this project on APC's side.  

    As a employee of NAS my role would be as a consultant who is in charge of systems analyst and project management for this individual project for APC. I will be communicating with many members/employees from APC but mostly will be dealing with Ms. Burdett when it comes to decision making and project overview.



Detailed Description of Scope of Work (body sections)
  Detailed explanation of the scope of work:
  - Topic of technical description (object, mechanism, or process)

    This project proposal has been brought on by APC’s need to expand and capitalize on their current standing in the publishing house market. The goal of APC to increase their business growth by 85% over the next 3 years. 	This will be achieved by creating better tracking then the current system has to offer, create better relationships with authors, creating a better outreach process to help their appearance to outside authors, and to adjust there “ideal market image” by what is trending.

    The new system not only has to upgrade hardware components of their current system but also the functionality of it. In order to streamline their new business processes, they need to shift from a paper-based system to digital in order to keep accurate and better track of there projects. This will help with efficiency, but also information loss which they detailed as a huge problem in their current system. Since all projects will be digital, they can be further organized and categorized by genre and trend to make decisions for the collective easier.

  - Audience analysis and use analysis for technical description

    APC’s new venture into there system update will increase their value as a business in several key areas. First it will solve there most notable problems that all involve lack of organization through not having a digital ecosystem. By creating a digital environment to take in manuscripts and store information about them as well as authors, trends, and published books there will be more information to look over and analyze for the future. This will not only help them after the initial upgrade, but it will also enable them to be in a better position in the future when they have more expansion or change.

    Given APC’s current position in the market as a publishing house with very little overhead they can initiate these changes with the opportunity to bring in more revenue with almost no increase to there current overhead discounting the potential hiring that would give them 11 total employees.
