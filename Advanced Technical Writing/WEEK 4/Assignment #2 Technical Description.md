## ASSIGNMENT #2 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

Introduction

    - In order to streamline their new business processes, APC needs to shift from a paper-based system to digital in order to keep accurate and better track of their projects. This will help with efficiency, but also information loss which they detailed as a huge problem in their current system. Since all projects will be digital, they can be further organized and categorized by genre and trend to make decisions for the collective easier.

  ❏ Brief indication of the nature and scope of the description.
    - In this description I will outline the entire process of APC's workflow in a short list manor, and then in parts of list I think need to be more in-depthly explained I will do so. This mostly takes place for processes are that are not already in place for APC and will be part of the new system that I am planning.

  ❏ Brief statement of why this object, mechanism, or process is significant to the reader.
    - This technical description will be a great overall outline for the APC team to review and look through when training to use there new system that is being developed. Then when future explanation is needed more in depth documents can be reviewed.

  ❏ Overview of the object, mechanism, or process – may include any of the following, as applicable:

    Historical background information
    Definition of object, mechanism, or process
    Context of use (where it is used, by whom, and for what purposes)

Detailed Description (body sections)
  ❏ Detailed explanation of object, mechanism, or process
  ❏ Uses appropriate styles of organization (spatial, functional, chronological, partition of the parts of the whole)
  ❏ Answers the following questions:

  What is the object, mechanism, or process?
    - How is it defined?
      The new workflow process that APC will employee is entirely digital system that will allow for multi system integration. This means that there will be separate systems that are in-charge of certain smaller business processes in a digital format.

    - What does the object, mechanism, or process do?
      Pending testing and changes the new APC workflow system will completely change the way that they go about there day to day work. All files will be digital, and be exchanged, edited, and tracked digitally. This will eliminate previous problems that APC had in the pass, along with optimizing there performance for future business endevers like electronic media.

    - What does the object, mechanism, or process look like?
      In order to construct this new workflow system there will be several changes to the technical environment of APC. First all computers will be upgraded to present day models. Then there will be off sight servers that will hold all of APC's data and be in charge of running there management systems.

    - What is the object or mechanism made of? (if you are describing an object or mechanism and not a process)
    - How does the object, mechanism, or process work?
    - Why should the reader be interested in your object, mechanism, or process?

Conclusion
  ❏ A brief closing statement that summarizes the value of knowing more about the object, mechanism, or process.
    - With the details that are given in this technical description APC will have a broad quick outline of there entire workflow with the new system along with having atiquite details of some of the more complex new systems that will be created after project approval. This technical description will be a great reference point for the pending approval of the project to the board members of APC when the project is presented.
