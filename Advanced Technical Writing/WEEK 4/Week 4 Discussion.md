## WEEK 4 DISCUSSION

This week's discussions continue our focus on technical instructions. Read each of the following and write a brief response to the prompt. Then, respond to TWO other classmates' posts.

1. Dozuki states (Links to an external site.): "Too many warnings -- especially ridiculous ones -- make the whole safety section seem silly. Then, no one takes the warnings seriously -- not even the real ones. Remember: You only have to caution users when a danger is "reasonably foreseeable."

2. Examine a product that has excessive or ridiculous warnings (either at home or on the Internet). Describe the warning information and what the underlying message is in that warning. Next, discuss what the manufacturer might revise to enhance the underlying message without over-legalizing the content.

3. Read the article "Woman, hit by car, sues Google for faulty directions (Links to an external site.)". Discuss the ethical and legal responsibilities of Google Maps in this case. Do you agree with the woman's case? Or do you side with Google's case? Explain your answer.
