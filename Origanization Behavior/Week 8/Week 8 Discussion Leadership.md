## WEEK 8 DISCUSSION | LEADERSHIP

Describe an incident in which someone has been an effective manager or leader over you.  The leader and situation might be from work, a sports team, a student work group, or any other setting where leadership might emerge.  For example, how a supervisor in a summer job pushed you to reach higher performance goals than you would have done otherwise.  State the actual behaviors that the leader used, not just general statements (e.g. "My boss sat down with me and we agreed on specific targets and deadlines, then he said several times over the next few weeks that I was capable of reaching these goals.").

  After sitting at looking at these assignment instructions and then thinking about leadership in my work or school life I honestly cant think of any. My previous work experience was in a freelance setting where I was working on my own to complete tasks. The managing parties at the business would tell me what they needed done and I would do it to those standards or better. There was never any leadership type behaviors such as support or designing my directives around my characteristics.

  To go along with this in school I cant think of any instances either. I never played in official team sports so there wasn't coaches or any leaders there. I went to a very "independent" school where they focused on individual learning and achievement. Whenever there was any work as a group there was never a leader everyone just divided up the work evenly to complete. Teachers would always talk to "everyone" as a whole on how they could be better, do better, and achieve more but I never really experienced any "coaching" me toward a goal since it wasn't really necessary.

  I'm actually kind of shocked as I write this because the more I think about it the more I realize how independent everything I have done has been. 

Which path-goal theory leadership style(s)--directive, supportive, participative, or achievement-oriented--did the leader apply in this incident?

  Since I don't have a scenario where I experienced leadership Ill use a scenario I observed where a fellow employee I worked with received the "directive" and "supportive" leadership approach.

  When working I was surrounded by sales people that every day would get calls, or make calls to clients or potential clients about our services. One day a mid level salesman made a call to a gentle men that was not so happy to receive what he thought was "fishing sales call". His responses over the phone became more and more aggressive and flippant that he continued to get these kind of calls every day and he was tired of it. At first the mid level salesman tried to assure the man that was calling because they were actually a client but the man refused to believe this and started "insulting" the salesman. At the end of the conversation my fellow employee had had it with this guy and said some choice words and hung up.

  After hanging up a higher level salesman came over and asked what happened. They talked about it and the higher level salesman stopped looked at the lower one and said he understood what had happened and why the mid level salesman had "lost his cool". Then he explained to him what he did wrong in the conversation. How he hadn't let the man on the phone speak long enough and voice his concerns and how he didn't make it clear as to why he was calling. Which in fact was a good reason since the man was a customer of our company.  

What made this leadership style (or styles) appropriate in this situation?

  These two styles of leadership were very important to the situation because not only did it contain the problem quickly and make sure that a relatively new employee felt heard it also corrected it right away. After this type of leadership occurred the mid level salesman called back apologized first off but then also had a constructive conversation where the man on the phone also realized his mistake and apologized as well.

What are your own strengths as a leader?  What could you do to make yourself a better leader?

  The strengths that are immediately apparent in my leadership style is my ability to control a group and divide up work according to that group. In other words I use the "directive" method constantly to up a firm foot in the door. This is often because of my own desire to complete projects, tasks on a schedule in the time required.

  This also leads to the thing that I lack most in leadership in most scenarios, support. A lot of the time I don't take into account others peoples situations. I often go right through the "supportive" part of the four path model and focus on setting "achievement" goals so we can finish.
