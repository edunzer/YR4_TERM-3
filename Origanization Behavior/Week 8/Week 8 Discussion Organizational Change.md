## WEEK 8 DISCUSSION | ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

COVID-19 has been a disruptor of epic proportions. Disruption sets the stage for change. Consider how the organization you work for (or the school you attend) should embrace change at this juncture.

Review this Deloitte article, COVID-19 and the Future of Work, (Links to an external site.) for inspiration. What is now possible that seemed impossible just 12 months ago?  What change would you like to see implemented in your organization? What internal drivers for change also exist?

Propose a change management strategy for your organization which (a) creates an urgency to change, (b) minimizes resistance to change, and (c) refreezes the situation to support the change initiative.

In your initial post (submitted by Friday), describe the change you would like to see implemented and your proposed strategy. Include references to the text and/or a Deloitte resource (Links to an external site.) as support for your strategy.

  As stated in many other articles that have come out during the pandemic it is more apparent then ever how many jobs can be done from home. Most of these are often in the tech field where all work is already done on a computer with most communications happening by phone, email, or video chat. Now although this has been apparent to many new startup companies that see the value in workers setting there own schedules and having the comfort of the home to help achieve tasks, many large companies still preferred them in person at the office.

  After the "disruption" of COVID everyone was forced into this work from home role and now large companies have to think about there new possibilities. There are several factors that will come into play with this decision. First off is many workers prefer to work from home. Secondly it is often more cost effective. Third work can be more effective, but sometimes can lack due to change in environment.

  This new movement has a wide range of possibilities but I think one thing is for certain, companies that have the capability to have work from home employees should start offering it. This will enable the company to not only save possible costs on office space but also can help improve there workforce. Businesses that have a single location often limit there possible workforce. By opening up remote positions the quality of employees could dramatically change since they are no longer location bound.

  Another factor that needs to be taken into account is that possible negatives can come from companies they are fresh out of the COVID bubble and think they want to go fully remote. A large amount of people "want" to work from home but not all of them "can" work from home. By this I mean there efficiency and effectiveness at there job could go down. There are many people that just cant get work done in the home environment and this could have huge negative factors on the business. In order to combat this I think it is imperative that if a business wants to change to a different work force style they do need to ease into it. Although many technologies have come out during the pandemic that can streamline work from home, as stated in the "COVID-19 and the Future of Work" article, most don't solve all the possible problems. Many in fact adhere to already existing standards that large corporations had in place and might not work for smaller businesses.    

  The best strategy for businesses to implement work from home is to slowly allows certain effective workers to pick if they want to work from home. Then after some time if work continues at the same rate or higher then you could implement more remote work management and strategies along with allowing workers to choose if they want to be remote or not.
