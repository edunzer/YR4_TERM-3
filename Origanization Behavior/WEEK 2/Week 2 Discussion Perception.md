## WEEK 2 DISCUSSION | PERCEPTION

You have been assigned to a small group of students for this discussion. Your original post (by Friday of this week) should address ONE of the following scenarios. No more than two students in the group can post on the same scenario. Make sure you reference material from the text (with page number cited) to support your post. No later than Sunday evening, reply with your insights to original posts from members of your group which respond to the two scenarios you did not address.

  1. Describe a mini-paradigm sift you have experienced.  How did this shift in paradigm  change your thoughts, feelings and behavior in the situation?

  2. You manage the human resources department for a mid-sized retailer. Part of the operations consists of a call center with 100 employees spread over three shifts operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There is a main group with 20 people reporting to a shift supervisor on the main daytime shift from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. There are regularly scheduled times for breaks and lunch. Recently senior management reported to you that they were concerned regarding tardiness of some employees. While the customer relationship management reports signal that there are no service issues, senior managers are concerned that they are overstaffed. You feel that the daytime shift is the most experienced group, and you do not want to lose some of the best employees through termination. You also do not have any budget money to use for incentive payments aimed at reducing tardiness. What ideas from operand conditioning, behavior modification, and social learning theory would you use to reduce the problems of tardiness?

  3. During a diversity management session, a manager suggests that stereotypes are a necessary part of working with others.  "I have to make assumptions about what's in the other person's head, and stereotypes help me do that," she explains.  "It's better to rely on stereotypes than to enter a working relationship with someone from another culture without any idea of what they believe in!"  What would Dr. Heim think of this statement? Discuss the merits and problems with this viewpoint.
