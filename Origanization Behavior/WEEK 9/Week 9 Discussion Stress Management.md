## WEEK 9 DISCUSSION | STRESS MANAGEMENT

Based on the self-assessments, what did you learn about your stress levels? What do you do to manage stress in your life? Based on information you have now acquired, from this module and reading in the textbook, identify a plan to better manage stress in your own life.

What are some methods that you would employ as manager to implement stress-reduction programs within your workplace?

  Based on the tests I would say that I do have higher then normal stress levels in some situations like appointments, but in others like working environments I have no stress. The data definitely shows that I have medium to low stress levels but when looking at certain questions that involve scheduling and time my stress tends to be higher. I've always known this but I've never really seen the data show it before.

  Since my stress has to do with time and scheduling I often mediate the problem by over planning everything. This enables me to see exactly what time I have and often makes me finish things early and arrive at appointments early. Overall I think this is a great way to help the problem from one perspective but when put into a scenario where there is no plan I often have a higher stress level then I would like which makes me think its counterproductive.
