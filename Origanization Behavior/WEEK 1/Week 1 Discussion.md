## WEEK 1 DISCUSSION | INTRODUCTION

Hi my name is Ethan. I am a junior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. This means that I will be going into the tech field; more specifically Web marketing, email marketing, and Web development. 

As far as information about me, I grew up in Lake Oswego (Portland) and moved to Bend 4 years ago then just recently moved back into the portland area. I am currently on a full class load but am actively looking for jobs and internships to start my career. 

The best advice that I have received is that you should always ask questions. Not just to show you are engaged or for your benefit but because your perspective might be different then others working on the same issue and your question could uncover potential problems.
