## WEEK 7 DISCUSSION | A PINCH

For this discussion think back on a significant incident when you experienced a "pinch" in a psychological contract  download. It could have taken place at school, in a work relationship, or a social relationship (with a group or club), or a personal relationship.

For this discussion, please prepare an original post addressing the four stages of Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle  as described below.

  Concrete Experience

    A great example of a "pinch" scenario is one that we all have had; the classic group project in school where no one does any work. I have had many experiences with group projects where there are only a few people that actually do the work. So many that the psychological contract has almost shifted where instead of believing that the other members are going to do work with me intervening instead I now just go in thinking that they aren't going to do the work unless told to.

    Actions like this really made me question why a teacher would ever put a group dynamic into school work that could easily be done by a single person. A lot of the time when events like this happened I would really get mad that my grade point average was affected by people that didn't care about there's.

  Reflective Observation

    And I'm sure that most people just didn't like working with others or they didn't like the class. I know in some instances I felt the same, but personally I always want to complete work on a project that is assigned. Its in my nature to finish things that are given to me, especially when my work effects other people.

  Abstract Conceptualization

    As shown in 4.3 of chapter 4 one of the first step to modifying behavior is creating criteria to define how someone would behave. Now the problem in my situation is that everyone that is "not doing the work" already knows what they should be doing they just don't have consequences because they are covered by the few people that do complete the work. In order to combat this problem teachers should use the "Conducting performance audits" method where individual work is then taken into account despite it being a group project. This could help make sure everyone is doing work since there individual work be in question and there will be no "group work" cover.

  Active Experimentation

    I most important part of these experiences that I learned is that if you want to be noticed in a group format you have to make your work known to the reviewer. This could limit the ability for others to take credit for the work that you have done.

    I personally learned that I have been driven to work along by peoples in ability to there own work. I remember specific instances where I would tell the teacher that Ill just work by myself instead of creating a group because I knew that despite there being enough work for several people that it would take more time dividing it up and checking to make sure the standards were met. This in part relates to my need to take control of all group work that I have done more recently, and has also made me natural group leader. When working with others I instantly divide up work and make decisions because although mine might not be the best I know that it will take to longer if no one takes charge.
