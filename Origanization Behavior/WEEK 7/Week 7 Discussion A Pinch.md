## WEEK 7 DISCUSSION | A PINCH

For this discussion, please prepare an original post addressing the four stages of Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle  as described below.

  Concrete Experience
    Objectively describe the experience (who, what, when, where, how)
    Subjectively describe your feeling, perception, and thoughts that occurred during the experience. What did others seem to be feeling?
  Reflective Observation
    Looking back at the experience, what were the perspectives of the key actors (including you)?
    Why did the people involved (including you) behave as they did?
  Abstract Conceptualization
    Relate concepts of theories from the assigned reading (use chapters 1-4) to the experience. First name the concept and describe it, then explain thoroughly how it applies to your experience. Apply at least two concepts or theories and indicate the page number in the text.
  Active Experimentation
    What did you learn from this experience?
    What did you learn about yourself?
    What action steps will you take to be more effective in the future?
